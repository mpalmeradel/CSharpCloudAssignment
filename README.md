C# Cloud Assignment

This is the assignment of 6CLP Cloud Computing. It involved modifying a supplied Visual Studio solution to utilize a cloud service
hosted on Microsoft Azure (which also hosted a SQL database). Some of the code from ABC Ed Services was provided by Dale Van Heer
of TAFE SA. The rest was created by me, namely ABCEdWCFService and WebApplication1 (The merit component, an ASP.NET solution which
also accessed the cloud services).
